# E-Commerce

I created this full-stack e-commerce website primarily to enhance my proficiency and comprehension of Bootstrap, Redux, and SQL. This was my first big project working with these technologies. 

The entire project is coded in TypeScript. I utilized React with Vite for the frontend and employed Node.js with Express for the backend. 

The design was crafted using Figma, and I ensured that the website is fully responsive, with various devices.
